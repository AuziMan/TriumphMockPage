# Triumph Mock Page
This repository hold the mockup from triumph tech. 

#  Task of the project: 
### I was given a PDF document with the goal of creating a functioning and responsive web page using HTML and CSS
### Because I am still learning bootstrap, I decided to create the initial design of the page using custon HTML+CSS 


---

#  General list of steps I took to build the page:
1. Create general page layout. The page has three obvious sections, so I started with defining those. 
2. I then started from the top, creating each section and experimenting with margin sizes. 
3. Once I had the general layout of the page set up, I utilized a tool call AngreyTool [AngreyTools](https://angrytools.com/) which had a helpful flexbox creator.
4. Once the page was formatted correctly, I slowly have started adding in the responsiveness by testing differnt methods.

# What I learned

1. This page really helped me understanbd margin and page sections alot
2. Getting the entire page layed out first helped me break down the page into smaller, easier steps to develop. 
3. No matter how confident you are, there is also so much more to learn in this industry.
